# Reading_comparison_FINALIZED
Aim is to compare two different readings from different devices. Here we have two devices that are called:
->ABB Inverter
->Fluke

Devices give us measurements of power readings of a solar PV panel. We are required to find the difference between the readings that belong to same time.

In this project these are generally used:
-Global file reading for effective file reading
-Python pandas library when dealing with big amount of data
-matplotlib library for plotting purposes
-Interpolating techniques when filling the missing values of readings
