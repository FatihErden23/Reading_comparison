# Reading_comparison
Aim is to compare two different readings from different devices. Here we have two devices that are called:
->ABB Inverter
->Fluke

Devices give us measurements of power readings of a solar PV panel. We are required to find the difference between the readings that belong to same time.

Project is finished with an IMPORTANT NOTE:
-Due to AM-PM consideration on Fluke reader, some data is lost since converting it to proper time object is very difficult. Power readings of Fluke during AM  hours are conserved, PM time readings are lost.
